# Empirical Alignment: An Ethical Framework for AI via Inverse Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository outlines a proposed ethical framework for AI system design and evaluation, grounded in **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)** and **graph-based modeling**. The core idea is to **infer values** from the **empirical actions of stakeholders** and use these values to **guide system design and behavior**.

Rather than relying solely on abstract principles or externally imposed norms, this framework captures **what kind of system should be providing value**, based on the preferences of those most affected by it.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**:  
  Used to infer a **reward function** that reflects the latent preferences of stakeholders, based on observed behavior.

- **System as Logical Graph**:  
  The system is modeled as a directed graph, where **nodes** represent functional components or decision points, and **edges** represent transitions or causal links.

- **Reward-Guided Traversal**:  
  The inferred reward function is used to simulate or evaluate different paths through the graph, identifying which branches best align with stakeholder values.

- **Ethical Evaluation**:  
  The resulting policy can be evaluated for **ethical alignment**, **stakeholder justifiability**, and **practical feasibility**.

## Ethical Objective

To construct systems that:
- Provide value as defined by those affected.
- Are accountable to empirical evidence of stakeholder preferences.
- Remain transparent and auditable in their ethical decision-making.

## Key Hypotheses

### I. Stakeholder Behavior
- **H1: Value Expressivity**  
  Stakeholder actions reliably reflect their underlying values.
  
- **H2: Sufficient Observability**  
  There is enough observable behavior to infer meaningful preferences.

- **H3: Rational Approximation**  
  Behavior is approximately reward-maximizing and can be modeled by IRL.

- **H4: Value Aggregation**  
  A coherent group reward function can be derived from diverse stakeholders.

---

### II. Inverse Reinforcement Learning
- **H5: Recoverability**  
  IRL can generalize reward functions to new, relevant contexts.

- **H6: Interpretability**  
  Inferred rewards are understandable and auditable by humans.

---

### III. System Modeling
- **H7: Graph Representability**  
  System behaviors and operations can be captured as a logical graph.

- **H8: Traversability**  
  The graph can be meaningfully traversed using a reward function.

- **H9: Modularity**  
  Local changes in the graph lead to predictable global behavior changes.

---

### IV. Ethical Alignment
- **H10: Empirical Alignment**  
  Reward-maximizing behaviors are ethically preferable when based on real stakeholder data.

- **H11: Justifiability**  
  Stakeholders can accept and justify policies grounded in their own revealed values.

- **H12: Norm Convergence**  
  Diverse, inclusive data leads to broadly acceptable ethical behavior.

- **H13: Non-Manipulability**  
  Stakeholders will not strategically distort behavior to game the reward inference.

---

### V. Practical Deployment
- **H14: Computational Feasibility**  
  The framework is tractable for real-world system scales.

- **H15: Updateability**  
  The model can adapt efficiently to new data over time.

- **H16: Policy Transferability**  
  Learned policies can transfer across similar domains with minimal degradation.
